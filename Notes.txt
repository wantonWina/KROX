- all tanks


TankGeometry object:
defines geometry/structure
cylindrical tank

cylindrical_geometry = CylindricalTank(radius=0.1, 
height=2.0, 
spherical_caps=False)

for custom weird things: 
custom_geometry = TankGeometry(
    geometry_dict={
        (-1, 1): lambda x: 0.1*x**2,
    }
)
The center of coordinate is always at the exact geometrical center of the tank.
(-1, 1) - domain (tuple) – Tuple containing the lower and upper bounds of the domain where the radius is valid.
0.1*x**2 - Function that defines the radius of the tank as a function of height.

all in meters. spherical_caps are idealized basically.

Fluid object:



- MassFlowRateBasedTank
- MassBassedTank


less accurate, assume uniform gas distribution filling all the portion that is not occupied by liquid. 
Therefore, these tanks can only model the tank state until the liquid runs out.
